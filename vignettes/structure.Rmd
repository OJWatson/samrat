## Structure

This is an overall structure of the `samrat` package, which details how the 
different analysis elements (parameters, analysis, plotting etc) are functionally
related. 

The package structure is shown below:

## Directory concepts

For each analysis, we will try to keep to a one directory per analysis structure,
which will include:

- Input parameter files (xlsx, csv, rds)
- Survey dataset directory

In this directory, the output of analysis will be stored in `output`. 

This setup can then be linked with suitable reproducibility pipelines later on
(cf [orderly](https://github.com/vimc/orderly)). 

## Conversion from mortality_small_area_estimation repo

In the [originating repository](mortality_small_area_estimation) the use of global
variables was quite extensive and made tracking where variables originated from
hard, with many variables being assigned using `get` and `assign` calls by reference
to `data.frames` that listed the names of the variables. This made it quite 
hard to identify where the variable originated from and when errors appear make
debugging almost impossible. In response, we choose to create names `lists` of variables 
and data sources. These are bundled within a `list`, in which the `data.frames` used 
to create these named `lists` are also included with the same name as in the 
original repo. 

For example, previously we had a predictors xlsx file. This had a `predictors_table` sheet that 
described each of the data sets that were being imported from the other sheets as 
well as a dictionary sheet with more information. From this, the `predictors_table` sheet
would be read in as `predictors` in the form of a `data.frame`. From this the actual predictor data
sets would be read in and assigned to variable names determined from `predictors`. 

Instead, we now opt for the `predictors` `data.frame` and the `dictionary` `data.frame` to
be named list elements within `predictors_list` - this is a list object that also has a 
`predictors_list` named element that is a named `list` of `data.frames` for the actual
predictor data sets. This way when referring to these, we know where they came from.
