## Structure

This is an overall structure of the `samrat` package, which details how the 
different analysis elements (parameters, analysis, plotting etc) are functionally
related. 

The package structure is shown below:

## Directory concepts

For each analysis, we will try to keep to a one directory per analysis structure,
which will include:

- Input parameter files (xlsx, csv, rds)
- Survey dataset directory

In this directory, the output of analysis will be stored in `output`. 

This setup can then be linked with suitable reproducibility pipelines later on
(cf [orderly](https://github.com/vimc/orderly)).
